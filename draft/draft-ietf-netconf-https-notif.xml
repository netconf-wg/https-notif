    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data module for configuring HTTPS based
      configured subscription, as defined in Subscribed Notifications
      (RFC8639). The use of HTTPS maximizes transport-level interoperability,
      while allowing for encoding selection from text, e.g. XML or JSON, to
      binary.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC8639">Subscribed Notifications</xref> defines a YANG
      data module for configuring subscribed notifications. It even defines a
      subscriptions container that contains a list of receivers. But it defers
      the configuration and management of those receivers to other documents.
      This document defines a <xref target="RFC7950">YANG</xref> data module
      for configuring and managing HTTPS based receivers for the
      notifications. Such a configured receiver can be a third party
      collector, collecting events on behalf of receivers that want to
      correlate events from different publishers. Configured subscriptions
      enable a server, acting as a publisher of notifications, to proactively
      push notifications to external receivers without the receivers needing
      to first connect to the server, as is the case with dynamic
      subscriptions.</t>

      <t>This document describes how to enable the transmission of YANG
      modeled notifications, in the configured encoding (i.e., XML, JSON) over
      HTTPS. It comes in the form of a HTTPS POST. The use of HTTPS maximizes
      transport-level interoperability, while the encoding selection pivots
      between implementation simplicity (XML, JSON) and throughput (text
      versus binary).</t>

    <section anchor="overview" title="YANG module">
      <section anchor="overview.protocol" title="Overview">
        <t>The YANG module is a definition of a set of receivers that are
        interested in the notifications published by the publisher. The module
        contains the TCP, TLS and HTTPS parameters that are needed to
        communicate with the receiver. The module augments the <xref
        target="RFC8639">Subscribed Notifications</xref> receiver container to
        create a reference to a receiver defined by the YANG module. As
        mentioned earlier, it uses POST method to deliver the notification.
        The attribute 'path' defines the absolute path for the resource on the
        receiver, as defined by 'path-absolute' in <xref target="RFC3986">URI
        Generic Syntax</xref>. The user-id used by <xref
        target="RFC8341">Network Configuration Access Control Model</xref>, is
        that of the receiver and is derived from the certificate presented by
        the receiver.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
      that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
      <xref target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref> or <xref
      target="RFC8040">RESTCONF</xref>. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
      transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
      <xref target="RFC6242">Secure Shell (SSH)</xref>. The lowest RESTCONF
      layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is <xref
      target="RFC8446">TLS</xref>. The <xref target="RFC8341">NETCONF Access
      Control Model (NACM) </xref> provides the means to restrict access for
      particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all
      available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.</t>

      <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
      writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
      These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
      network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data
      nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
      operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
      sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
      notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes
      and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

      <t>Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
      sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
      important to control access to these operations. These are the
      operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>
